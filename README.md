# Gender-and-Age-Detection-using-CNN
Age and gender prediction for various applications of facial recognition, such as security.

Gender and age detection is a process that comprises of detection, alignment, 
feature extraction, and a recognition task. In our program, we train the code on a 
prepared dataset to assign labels to the faces. It extracts unique characteristics 
from that personâ€™s face that it can use to differentiate him from another person, 
like eyes, mouth, nose, etc. Later on, with the help of this training the data is 
tested and the tag is given to the photo.
We have done this project using OpenCV , CNN and python language. OpenCV 
has many built-in libraries and functions for image processing
